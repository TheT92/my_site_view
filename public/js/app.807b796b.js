For the PC management platform, we utilize React.js to create dynamic front-end pages, ensuring seamless interaction with data by employing a clear separation between the front-end and back-end, which allows us to effectively request back-end interfaces. On the mobile and tablet fronts, we leverage UNI-APP, a widely adopted cross-platform hybrid app development framework in the Chinese market, utilizing Vue.js for our coding efforts.","Throughout my tenure, I have accomplished two tasks that I consider particularly significant. The first involves the successful integration of 3D models, SVG circuit diagrams, and SVG device distribution maps within the tablet application. These visual elements are accompanied by interactive hotspot information, allowing users to engage with different areas of the SVG or 3D model, which respond to various operational events. This task required extensive research and experimentation across multiple facets, ultimately culminating in a successful and high-quality implementation.","The second noteworthy achievement was the development of an offline locking mechanism for an application designed specifically for one of our clients. Upon the expiration of the customer's usage period, the app needed to be locked, rendering it inaccessible. The challenge arose from the app’s purely offline nature, necessitating a creative solution for remote locking. I devised a clever approach wherein, upon expiration of the customer's permission, the application would forcibly redirect to a specific page. I implemented an encryption algorithm to generate a QR code containing critical information such as the machine's unique code and the system time. The customer would then send this QR code to us for decryption, allowing us to generate a new secret key QR code that we would return to them. Upon scanning this new QR code, the customer could reactivate the app and extend their usage period. This innovative offline locking and unlocking mechanism is among the accomplishments I am most proud of in my professional career.","In reflection, my experience at my previous company allowed me to make substantial contributions to the project's success while developing my technical skills and problem-solving capabilities. I take pride in the innovative solutions I provided, which not only addressed client needs but also enhanced the overall functionality of the platform.
