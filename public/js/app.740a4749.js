Using the Hawkeye device management system, enterprises could monitor the operating status of machines, track the full lifecycle of equipment (procurement, usage, and inventory), and create different categories of tasks—such as production, maintenance, and inspection—while associating relevant devices with each task. Hawkeye also supported fine-grained permission controls, workflow approvals, multi-role collaboration, and other enterprise-level features required by modern industrial operations.","Hawkeye also included built-in support for advanced visualization features, such as 3D interactive equipment models and 2D factory-floor layout diagrams. These native capabilities allowed enterprises to display production lines, workshops, and equipment structures directly within the platform, enhancing operational visibility and enabling more intuitive device management and monitoring.","To meet different business scenarios, Hawkeye was delivered across multiple platforms, including web, mobile WAP, native mobile applications, and WeChat mini-programs. Its technology stack covered Java Spring, MySQL, React, React Native, Vue, and UNI-APP. I was involved in both the frontend and backend development across nearly every major module of the system.","Beyond the standard product, many customers required additional features tailored to their internal workflows.

On the backend, I implemented API endpoints, handled data processing, and integrated business logic to support frontend features and improve overall system performance.","Among the many tasks I completed, two achievements stood out as the most technically challenging and meaningful:","<span class='fs-1 text-primary'>1.

Design and Implementation of a Fully Offline App Locking and Unlocking Mechanism</span>","One of our clients required that the mobile application operate in a completely offline environment. However, to control licensing and usage periods, we needed a secure method to lock and unlock the app without any network connectivity. After evaluating several third-party solutions and finding none suitable, I independently designed a custom cryptographic mechanism for offline authorization.","The mechanism worked as follows:","1. When the client’s usage period expired, the app automatically locked itself and redirected the user to a dedicated page.","2. The app generated a QR code containing encrypted device information, including:","<ul>\n                        <li>Device UUID</li>\n                        <li>Local system time</li>\n                        <li>Random salt</li>\n                        <li>etc.</li>\n                    </ul>","3.
